            IPL Auction 2019 Date, Time, Venue, Schedule, Players List, Rules: IPL Auction will be held on a single day as against the previous years of two days with new auctioneer and in a new city.<br><br>
            IPL 2019 Auction moves from its regular programming of being stretched over two days and start in the morning to a mid-day affair in a single day. The auction will allow all franchises to firm up their strategies to pick the players they think would be best suited for their side. A total of 346 cricketers have been listed with the salary cap being raised from Rs 80 to Rs 82 crores. With the removal of Richard Madley, a different auctioneer will be banging the gavel. That man is Hugh Edmeades but he will be overseeing an event that is far more low key compared to the marathon mega-auction of the previous season. The 346 cricketers in the auction will be split into three groups- batsman, bowler and all-rounder. Ahead of the auction, every team provided a list of players retained and released. While most of the teams release quite a few players, defending champions Chennai Super Kings have released only three players.<br><br>
